# AI & Machine Learning Engineering Journey 🚀

> **From Mathematical Foundations to Production Deployment.**

This repository documents my intensive journey transitioning into AI Engineering. It focuses on three core pillars:
1.  **Mathematics:** Implementing algorithms (Linear Regression, Backprop) from scratch without libraries.
2.  **Engineering:** Deploying models using Docker, FastAPI, and Cloud Platforms.
3.  **Deep Learning:** Building Neural Networks, CNNs, and Transformers using PyTorch.
